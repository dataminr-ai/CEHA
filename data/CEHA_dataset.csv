“This is the time for the Amhara people to crush the terrorist group,” Sema Tiruneh, the Amhara region’s head of peace and security, told the regional state-affiliated Amhara Media Corporation. “Everyone should come forward and defend themselves.”
In response, Tigray forces’ spokesman Getachew Reda told The Associated Press that “we’ll extend a warm welcome.” The conflict threatens to destabilize Africa’s second most populous country, where thousands of people have already been killed in the nine-month war.
In a phone interview, Getachew said Tigray forces have crossed into the Amhara region, and the Afar region, in recent weeks in an attempt to break the blockade that Ethiopia’s government has imposed on Tigray. Hundreds of thousands of people face famine conditions, and the United Nations and United States this week sent high-level officials to Ethiopia to urge more access for aid.
“We have to deal with anyone who’s still shooting,” Getachew said. “If it takes marching to Addis to silence the guns, we will. But I hope we’ll not have to.” Civilians shouldn’t fear, he said in response to allegations by ethnic Amhara that the Tigray forces have carried out attacks.",Yes,,X,,,,,train

U.N.-backed human rights experts say war crimes continue in Ethiopia despite a peace accord signed nearly a year ago to end a conflict that engulfed the country’s northern Tigray region. The violence has left at least 10,000 people affected by rape and other sexual violence — mostly women and girls, they found.
They warned of “hallmark risks” that the violence could spread further, producing more “atrocity crimes” and jeopardize security more broadly in East Africa. With a multiethnic population of about 120 million, Ethiopia is by far the most populous country in the region.
The experts’ report, published Monday, comes against the backdrop of an uncertain future for the team of investigators who wrote it: The U.N. Human Rights Council is set to decide early next month whether to extend the team’s mandate in the face of efforts by the Ethiopian government of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to end it.

A1,GDELT,914644261,20200326,Ethiopia,OROMO,STUDENT,https://theowp.org/no-news-on-ethiopian-students-kidnapped-on-december-2019/,"On December 2019, 18 students from Dembi Dolo University in western Ethiopia were abducted, allegedly by the Oromo Liberty Front (OLF) while travelling to the capital Addis Ababa through Gambella. 14 women and 4 male, mostly ethnic Amharas students were feeling from ethnic violence and threats in their university located in Oromia region. Only one student, Asmira Shumiye managed to escape from her captives. After her escape, it took months for the Ethiopian government to act on the issue. Organized protests and social media campaign, “#BringBackOurStudents,” had little effect. On January 11, the prime minister’s office said that 21 students were released while 6 were still missing. According to BBC News, there is no clarity on why there is a huge disparity of numbers. Contrary to the office’s statement students’ families say they have not heard from them, which fueled more anti-governmental protests and more pressure on the government to take action to bring the students back their homes.
Asmira, who escaped from her captors, said that they were selected and forced to leave the bus by men “looked like gangsters.” According to her, they were speaking in Afaan Oromo language and told them that their problem was with the government, which made the allegations against OLF stronger, even though the group denies any ties to the event. A family member of one of the students, Mare Abebe to BBC said, “We don’t know whether they are alive or not, but we can’t do anything unless the government return our children or lets us know what happened to them.” Another parent Yeneneh Adugnam told the AP news “We are living in an anguish every day… We want to know whether they are alive or dead. No one is giving us any information.” Similarly, the activist, Meti Shewaye Yilma, through Twitter, asked the government if there were any news or progress made on the case. In January, the former deputy president of Amhara region, Lake Ayalew admitted that there was little effort made to release the students which led it to become long term problem. It has been months since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed met with worried parents and assured them that their children would return safely. According to BBC, the Prime Minister seemed to be at a loss when no one took responsibility for the kidnappings. In February he said, “If we could say something bad happened to the students, there is no evidence to show that,” to keep the hopes high.
Ethiopian people appear to be suffering from inter-ethnic division and tension between Oromo and Amhara people. This tension sparked with the foundation of OLF in 1973 and still goes on. Regardless, if OFL is responsible for the kidnapping of the students or not, what Asmira said about her captors may indicate that this event was fueled by the ethnical tension. The unclarity of the numbers announced by the government and their claims of the majority of students being freed despite parents’ concern of not hearing back from these supposedly freed students are concerning and shows us how the government is lacking control on the situation. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed should take more action in collecting information on the incident and locate the location of the captives. Many families and friends are suffering from this tragic event and not having heard from their loved ones diminish their hope every day. These people need their government to provide information on the situation of their loved ones to either keep their hopes on or mourn. Hopefully, Mr. Ahmed will listen to his people and successfully bring back their loved ones.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed who himself from Oromo ethnicity, took the office in 2017. He was praised for having a gender-equal cabinet and ending a two-decade-long conflict with Eritrea which led him to be awarded the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize. His policy to open up the political space under which he invited several opposition leaders to Ethiopia in 2018, and loosening of state controls, according to Deutsche Welle, reignited the ethnic conflicts. In Ethiopia’s south, there is the unresolved conflict between the Oromo, one of the largest ethnic group with the population of 100 million, and ethnic Somalis over land which displaced hundreds of thousands of people. In the west of the country, many were killed in the clashes between armed groups and the army. And this ongoing violence and insecurity led to increasing criticism of the government. While the public criticized the government for failing to protect its people, Oromos were accusing the officials of discriminating against them. The clashes between Amhara and Oromos people was spread to the Dembi Dolo University campus. In the past few months, clashes resulted in the killing of 12 students and 35,000 dropping out of university.
It has been three months since the kidnapping of these students, hopefully soon the government can be able to answer the questions families have. It seems if the group responsible for the instance announce their reasons, who they are and what they want this can give families hope and required intelligence to the government. For a long-term solution to prevent events like this happening, the Ethiopian government should work to end this inter-ethnic conflict going on.",No,3. A summary of different situations,,,,,,train

Thousands have died since fighting began in November, many of them civilians.

The protracted nature of the ongoing conflict in Sudan portrays a grim outlook, with it so far lacking any conclusion or resolution. It is disheartening to witness how two rival generals have effectively converted the peaceful capital Khartoum into a dreadful battleground, driven solely by their personal vendettas.
The ongoing power struggle in Sudan involves two influential figures vying for control and authority. At the forefront, we have Gen. Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan, a prominent military commander who has assumed the de facto leadership role in Sudan, for an extended period, through his commanding presence and actions. Opposing him is Gen. Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, who holds leadership over the Rapid Support Forces, a formidable paramilitary group within the country. This intricate power dynamic experienced a significant turning point in October 2021, when Al-Burhan and Dagalo formed an alliance to orchestrate a military coup that resulted in their ascension to the positions of effective leader and deputy leader of Sudan, respectively. However, the harmony between these two leaders has deteriorated, leading to public clashes and disagreements.
These tensions have manifested themselves in overt and covert maneuvers, as both generals have been observed deploying additional troops and equipment to military camps in Khartoum and across the nation. This accumulation of forces is a worrisome escalation, reflecting their intensified rivalry and determination to consolidate their power and influence. Regrettably, the civilian populace of Sudan is bearing the brunt of this power struggle. Within the city of Khartoum, an unfortunate multitude of individuals have found themselves trapped within the confines of their own homes since the initial eruption of violence on April 15. Perpetrators stationed in various central neighborhoods have engaged in relentless exchanges of fire, utilizing rooftops and the narrow spaces between buildings to target the warplanes above. This prolonged siege has resulted in an intermittent electricity supply, essential provisions such as food and water becoming scarce and a surge in incidents of looting and robbery, further intensifying the hardships endured by residents. According to the Ministry of Health, the distressing casualty figures stemming from the ongoing conflict indicate a civilian death toll in excess of 865, with an additional 5,000 individuals sustaining injuries. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that these reported numbers likely represent a conservative estimate, with the actual magnitude of human suffering and loss probably surpassing the official figures. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has severe apprehensions regarding the ongoing conflict in Sudan and its dire consequences for civilians. According to spokesman Jeremy Laurence, the office highlighted a particularly distressing incident that occurred last week involving an attack on a bustling livestock market in Khartoum. This assault tragically resulted in the loss of eight civilian lives, including three members of the same family. The Sudanese Armed Forces was responsible for the airstrike on the Al-Muwaliyyah market. Additionally, Laurence mentioned another incident that took place on the same day, when a child was reportedly killed after a shell struck their family residence in southern Khartoum. These incidents exemplify the grave toll being exacted on innocent lives amid the conflict. In the quest to end the conflict and restore peace, there are several measures that the US could consider implementing. Firstly, it could leverage its diplomatic influence by engaging in high-level negotiations with the conflicting parties in Sudan. By actively mediating and facilitating dialogue, America can encourage the rival factions to seek common ground, while emphasizing the importance of human rights, stability and reconciliation in their discussions. Moreover, Biden’s administration can exert diplomatic pressure on Sudan by collaborating with international partners and organizations, such as the UN and regional bodies like the African Union. By coordinating efforts and leveraging collective influence, a united front can be presented to Sudanese authorities, reinforcing the imperative of a rights-based approach and encouraging them to actively pursue a peaceful resolution.
In addition to such diplomatic endeavors, Washington can offer support for humanitarian efforts within Sudan. By providing robust assistance, including financial aid, resources and expertise, the US can contribute to alleviating the dire humanitarian conditions the Sudanese population faces. This could involve facilitating access to food, clean water, healthcare and shelter, thereby addressing the immediate needs of the affected civilians. Furthermore, the leader of the free world could prioritize efforts to strengthen governance structures, the rule of law and institutions in Sudan. The US could help establish a foundation for sustainable peace and stability by promoting transparency, accountability and inclusive governance. This may involve supporting capacity-building programs, fostering civil society engagement and promoting initiatives that uphold human rights, democracy and the rule of law. By aligning its actions with its stated commitment to human rights, the Biden administration could demonstrate its dedication to upholding its fundamental values and principles, while working toward a positive resolution in Sudan.",No,3.

Simmering tensions between the federal government of Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and authorities in the country’s Tigray region reached a flashpoint, sowing the seeds of yet another humanitarian crisis in Africa.
While there are no official numbers on casualties, it is believed that hundreds of lives have already been lost on both sides, many of them civilians.
The assault, officially termed “a law enforcement” operation, has included use of air force jets and ground troops against the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), the ruling party of the eponymous region. Abiy said he had no choice but to order the offensive after federal defense forces in the Tigrayan capital, Mekelle, had their camp looted in an attack by the TPLF.

It arrested Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok and declared a state of emergency. In a statement, Sudan’s top general Abdel Fattah al-Burhan said the army had to step in because political rivalries “stirred up strife” and could lead to civil war. Al-Burhan’s move has earned near-unanimous international condemnation and stiff opposition at home, as huge protests continue to be organised.
Sudan’s escalating political crisis following the coup, now a threat to the very survival of the state, has its roots in the anomalous institutional architecture of the current political transition and the complicated relationship between its major protagonists.
The transition, which started after longtime President Omar al-Bashir was forced to step down by a popular uprising in 2019, is among the most prolonged and complicated among Sudan’s numerous past experiences and unique in the mutual hostility of its main partners.
The first (often neglected) transition the country went through was the 1953-55 self-government period, which started with an election while Sudan was still under British colonial rule. The constitution, the Self-Government Statute of 1953, was agreed in advance under colonial supervision.

The largest criminal organization in Somalia is al Shabaab. Given the history of Somalia that should not be a surprise. Britain administered Somalia from 1884 to 1960 and after much effort imposed more peace, prosperity and unity than the region had ever known. That lasted until about two decades after independence and then the usual bad habits began tearing Somalia apart again. The tribal/clan rivalries kept the pot boiling and even the rise of a ""clean government"" party (the Islamic Courts) after 2001, based on installing a religious dictatorship, backfired and turned into another warlord group called al Shabaab. That caused even more Somalis to flee their homeland and led to even more problems as Somali refugees throughout Africa and worldwide. While doing that Somalis acquired a reputation for organized violence and criminal behavior as well as entrepreneurial success.
Meanwhile, al Shabaab still has a lot of popular support. The majority of Somalis oppose Islamic terrorism but a significant minority (up to 20 percent) support or tolerate groups like al Shabaab. The main reason for the support is desperation for a solution to the poverty, corruption, factionalism and chaos that makes Somalia such a dangerous place to live in. Overcoming those ancient traditions is the main obstacle to peace and there is no quick solution. Al Shabaab survives because its leaders concentrated on finances and pay its bills.
For example, since 2018 al Shabaab has had an arrangement with Kenyan peacekeeper force commanders who will take bribes to allow al Shabaab controlled charcoal production and export of that charcoal to Dubai. This has long been the main source of income for al Shabaab. When al Shabaab lost control of the southern port of Kismayo in 2014, al Shabaab's income fell by more than half. Since then al Shabaab has established other income sources, mainly smuggling in areas it controls, along with extortion and anything else it can get away with. The charcoal operations is worth about $15 million a year to al Shabaab, which comprises over a third of the income that currently keeps about 7,000 al Shabaab members going.
So far Kenya has been reluctant to crack down, apparently because some prominent Kenyan families are involved. At least that is usually the main reason for ignoring clear evidence of corruption. While not as corrupt as Somalia, which is ranked the most corrupt of 180 nations worldwide, Kenya comes in 137th. Al Shabaab has worked a little harder to find a corruptible Kenyan official but finding someone is not impossible.
Al Shabaab still uses force when bribes won’t work. Force is not only cheaper but often more lucrative. In the last year about a thousand violent acts can be traced back to al Shabaab. Most of this violence took place in southern Somalia and northern Kenya and most were about economics, not religion. Al Shabaab members are more gangsters than religious fanatics.",No,3.

Instead of a ceasefire, allowing countries and humanitarian organisations to focus on battling the COVID-19 pandemic, ongoing violence is pushing millions to the brink of conflict induced famine and hindering the battle against the outbreak.
Leading aid organisations urge Heads of State meeting today in the Security Council in New York to urgently renew their call for a global ceasefire, and to accelerate COVID-19 response capacity and access in areas affected by conflict and humanitarian crisis.
The UN Secretary-General issued his first call for a global ceasefire in March, yet early signs of progress have since stalled, as armed groups have continued or even increased fighting. This is contributing to a devastating increase in food insecurity and the likelihood of famine caused by conflict. The UN issued a warning only last week on the risk of conflict-induced famine in South Sudan, Yemen, DRC and northeast Nigeria. The economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have only worsened food insecurity, with an estimated additional 110 million children going hungry globally as a result of the pandemic.
In South Sudan, increased inter-communal violence has contributed to nearly 6.5 million people, or over half of the country’s population, facing dire levels of food insecurity. In Yemen, where humanitarian organisations face extremely challenging barriers to access to those most in need, civilians continue to fall victim to airstrikes and high levels of acute food insecurity. In DRC, aid workers have come under attack recently, and hunger levels are spiking in the Ituri district as a consequence of ongoing conflict.
The lack of progress towards peace is leaving millions of people suffering from the impacts of war and the global COVID-19 pandemic, the aid organisations warn, whilst limiting humanitarian access to extremely vulnerable communities. As the virus continues to compound suffering and drive the threat of famine across different conflict zones, it is vital political leaders put their weight behind the call for a humanitarian pause to fighting, facilitate safe and sustained access for aid workers, and accelerate COVID-19 response in conflict and humanitarian crisis affected countries.",No,3.

The most comprehensive report yet into the conflict, which has centred around the rebel province of Tigray, includes a string of first-hand accounts of massacres, torture and sexual violence in a war that began almost exactly a year ago.
It was released the day after Ethiopia declared a state of emergency and two days after Tigrayan forces said they may march on the capital to topple the government.
Michelle Bachelet, the UN high commissioner for human rights, said there were “reasonable grounds to believe” that “all parties to the Tigray conflict have committed violations of international human rights, humanitarian and refugee law. Some of these may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity.”
Significantly, the high commissioner added that “the majority of the violations” documented between November 2020 and June 2021 – the initial phases of the conflict – appear to have been committed by Ethiopian forces and their Eritrean allies as they attacked and occupied Tigray. But she added that since the Tigrayans had staged a successful counter-offensive that potentially threatened the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, there were “an increasing number of allegations of human rights abuses by Tigray forces”.",No,3.

It is believed that Islamist radicals in the area were guilty of burning down three churches on December 28th, 2019. These three buildings belonged to the Sudan Interior Church, Roman Catholic Church and Orthodox Church. After they were initially burned down, each of the congregations then built temporary structures. Each of these were then burned down again on January 16th.
An anonymous local pastor in Bout told Morningstar News confirmed this incident. “This incident is true; the three churches were set on fire twice in less than a month.” However, the new Minister for Religious Affairs, Nasr al-Din Mufreh has said that the government in Sudan is dedicated to religious freedom and has been investigating this situation. He said that as far as he knew, only one church had been attacked and the police had arrested and interrogated one suspect. They then released this suspect saying that there was not enough evidence.
If the new government in Sudan wants to show that it is truly changing, then they need to help rebuild these churches, prosecute those who conducted this act, and create and enforce extremely strict laws about attacking anyone of any faith and their places of worship. If they do not, then it will show that they have not changed as much as they have said.

Due to the war in Afghanistan, however, the armed drone cat has been truly let out of the bag. This now goes far beyond the scope of U.S. involvement, as the civilian casualties in Ethiopia’s ongoing conflict show.
President Biden voiced concern about air strikes during Ethiopia’s 14-month-long civil conflict in a phone conversation with Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed on January 10. That was the same day 17 Tigrayan civilians were killed and 21 injured, most of them women, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, after an air strike, reportedly by a drone, hit a flour mill. Since the year began, at least 108 civilians have been killed, reportedly, and 75 others injured because of air strikes allegedly carried out by the Ethiopian air force, the U.N. estimates.
A question hangs over the role of foreign-supplied drones in such attacks, which takes us back to those days when the dragon’s teeth of drone warfare were sown in Afghanistan. In the aftermath of 9/11, when all bets were off, Afghanistan became the crucible of drone use and development—the birthplace of the armed drone. But due to U.S. tendencies to guard its best toys—especially the technology involved in the Reapers and Predators that I worked with in Afghanistan during a six month tour in Helmand Province—other nations have stepped in to fill the gap in the market:
“The United States, unwilling to share advanced technology, has been sidelined by regional competitors that manufacture armed drones that, while not as efficient, are still able to turn the tide, becoming decisive weapons in any modern conflict,” reports Al Jazeera.
By the end of last year, the Tigrayan Defence Forces (TDF) had completed a stunning comeback after their defeat in November 2020 put federal forces in control of Tigray. The TDF pushed hundreds of kilometers south through enemy territory in the neighboring region of Amhara and captured two key towns viewed as gateways to Addis Ababa.

The current conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary group established by Sudan’s deposed president Omar al-Bashir, has already claimed the lives of more than 12,000 and displaced more than six million people since it broke out in April.
This is all happening against the backdrop of one of the world’s largest, most pressing humanitarian disasters. According to the U.N. Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), approximately 25 million Sudanese people, or half the country, are in dire need of humanitarian assistance. In Darfur, hundreds of miles away from Khartoum, the indigenous non-Arab ethnic groups are even more vulnerable, living under the reign of RSF terror and genocidal violence. The RSF has left a trail of mass atrocities in its wake with near impunity, reminiscent of the same brutal tactics used by the Janjaweed in the 2000s. Today, the RSF, as the Janjaweed’s successor entity, is committing the same atrocities and targeting the same indigenous groups on the international community’s watch. During the Janjaweed atrocities of the 2000s, policymakers not only failed to act in time to prevent genocide but even downplayed the nature of the violence to preserve other political interests. This time, there can be no debate over the magnitude of the horrors facing non-Arab ethnic groups at the hands of the RSF, or excuse for the repetition of our collective failure to uphold the promise of never again.
The 2003-2005 Genocide
In 2003, the former Sudanese president Omar Al Bashir unleashed a “counterinsurgency” war that, in reality, sent the SAF to bomb, and the Janjaweed militias to raze villages, kill, rape, loot, and force non-Arab populations to leave their homes. While the U.N. brought the full weight of its powers to bear, the international community still failed to prevent the unfathomable number of deaths, estimated to be upwards of 300,000, and the displacement of more than five million people.
In 2004 and 2005, the U.N. Security Council (UNSC) adopted a series of resolutions, still in effect, (1) imposing an arms embargo on non-state actors in Darfur, including the Janjaweed (Res. 1556), (2) mandating a sanctions regime against those impeding the peace process, threatening stability, or committing atrocities, (Res. 1591), and, (3) for the first time, referring the situation to the International Criminal Court (ICC) (Res. 1593). This was happening at a time of optimism for a future where the international community would not stand idly by as mass atrocities are perpetrated with impunity. The ICC issued arrest warrants against the former President Omar al-Bashir, the Court’s first against a head of state and only genocide charge, and three other high-ranking Sudanese officials; all of whom remain at large, while a fifth, Ali Kushayb, a senior Janjaweed commander, is now on trial.",No,3.

On November 4, Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announced military attacks against the Tigray region, which borders Eritrea and Sudan, and its governing party, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF). The prime minister, who positioned himself as a reformer and peacemaker since taking office in 2018, and won the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize for clinching a long-awaited peace deal between his country and Eritrea, declared an all-out war on a regional government as a means to settle an ideological and political difference.
The war in Tigray is a continuation of the violent and widespread repression Abiy began in Oromia, Walaita and Sidama against those who resisted his vision of the future. After silencing dissent and opposition elsewhere in the country, Abiy and his camp are turning to Tigray, the last frontier in the battle over the character of the Ethiopian state.
Tigray presents a significant challenge to the prime minister’s grandiose vision of “Making Ethiopia Great Again” (MEGA). In addition to being an autonomous region with effective control over its territories, it is a battle-hardened region with highly trained troops and access to much of Ethiopia’s military arsenal.
Although Abiy’s government is scrambling to convince the world that this is a law enforcement operation with limited and achievable objectives, the fierce battles fought over the last few weeks involving fighter jets, tanks, and armoured personnel carriers make it evident that the country is in the midst of what is likely to be an intractable military deadlock that would result in a large number of casualties.",No,3.

One additional staff member was injured and a Muslim teacher was abducted. These attackers appeared not to target the female staff.

Addis Abeba, April 19, 2021 – Despite previous eye witnesses and families of victims accounts and statements by the Oromia Regional state chapter of the ruling Prosperity Party, Oromia Prosperity Party (OPP) disputing the presence of the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) often referred by the government as ‘OLF/Shene’, the Amhara regional state and its chapter of the ruling party, Amhara Prosperity Party (APP) have repeatedly blamed the attacks on the OLA. According to Amhara Media Cooperation (AMC), violence broke out on Wednesday evening. Quoting the head of Efrata Gidim woreda, Demisew Meshesha, AMC reported that violence broke out in Ataye after a house was burned down. Demisew said that there were tensions in surrounding areas but calm has returned after the deployment of federal and regional security forces. However, the violence escalated over the following days causing property destruction and driving people out of Ataye to neighboring towns.
Residents of Shewa Robit who AMC spoke to said that the violence spread to the neighboring town, Shewa Robit over the weekend. The residents said that they are being attacked by an armed group in civilian clothing. “We are defending ourselves because our attackers are well organized.” the residents said, adding “They came and attacked us after federal forces passed by the town.” The residents also told AMC that the recurring violence has been claiming lives and causing property destruction for the last two years. The residents say that this round of violence is unusually intense and has caused the people to flee to neighboring towns. “Electricity was cut off and food products were set ablaze.” they said and pleaded for the deployment of security forces. Taddese Gebretsadik, the administrator of North Showa zone told AMC that that conflict that started in Ataye later spread to Majete, Alala Negeso, Jawuha and Showa Robit.

The atrocities were perpetrated in and around Chenna and Kobo in late August and early September 2021, shortly after Tigrayan forces took control of the areas in July. The attacks were often characterized by additional acts of violence and brutality, death threats, and the use of ethnic slurs and derogatory remarks. In Kobo, Tigrayan forces were apparently lashing out at the civilian population in retaliation for increased resistance from local militias and armed residents.
“Tigrayan forces have shown utter disregard for fundamental rules of international humanitarian law which all warring parties must follow. Evidence is mounting of a pattern of Tigrayan forces committing war crimes and possible crimes against humanity in areas under their control in the Amhara region from July 2021 onwards. This includes repeated incidents of widespread rape, summary killings and looting, including from hospitals,” said Sarah Jackson, Deputy Regional Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes at Amnesty International.
""The TPLF leadership must put an immediate end to the atrocities we have documented and remove from its forces anyone suspected of involvement in such crimes.""
Tigrayan forces have shown utter disregard for fundamental rules of international humanitarian law which all warring parties must follow. This includes repeated incidents of widespread rape, summary killings and looting, including from hospitals. Sarah Jackson, Deputy Regional Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes at Amnesty InternationalSummary killings in KoboIn Kobo, a town in the north-east of the Amhara region, Tigrayan fighters deliberately killed unarmed civilians, seemingly in revenge for losses among their ranks at the hands of Amhara militias and armed farmers. Amnesty International interviewed 27 witnesses and survivors, including some who helped to collect and bury the bodies.Ten Kobo residents told Amnesty International that in the afternoon of 9 September 2021, Tigrayan fighters summarily killed their relatives and neighbours outside their homes.“First they shot my brother Taddese… He died on the spot. My other brother and my brother-in-law tried to move away and were both shot in the back and killed… they shot me in my left shoulder… I stayed down, pretending to be dead,” a survivor told Amnesty International.Twelve other Kobo residents said that they found the bodies of local residents and labourers who had been killed execution-style – shot in the head, chest or back, some with their hands tied behind their backs.“The first dead bodies we saw were by the school fence. There were 20 bodies lying in their underwear and facing the fence and three more bodies in the school compound. Most were shot at the back of their heads and some in the back. Those who were shot at the back of their heads could not be recognized because their faces were partially blown off,” one male resident said.The first dead bodies we saw were by the school fence.

Fourteen of the 30 survivors interviewed by Amnesty International said that they were gang-raped by multiple Tigrayan fighters, and some were raped in front of their children. Seven of the survivors were girls under the age of 18.Lucy, a 14-year-old seventh-grade student, and her mother were both raped by Tigrayan fighters in their home in Did-Bahr. She told Amnesty International: “I was at home with my mother and my grandmother when two young men with rifles came to our home in the morning at about 11. One of them wore military clothes and the other wore civilian clothes. They spoke a mix of Tigrinya and some Amharic. They said ‘Our families were raped and now it is our turn to rape you.’ One of them raped me in the courtyard and the other raped my mother inside the house. My mother is very sick now, she is very depressed and desperate. We don’t speak about what happened; it is impossible.”I was at home with my mother and my grandmother when two young men with rifles came to our home in the morning at about 11. One of them wore military clothes and the other wore civilian clothes. They spoke a mix of Tigrinya and some Amharic. They said ‘Our families were raped and now it is our turn to rape you.’ Lucy, a 14-year-old girl from Did-BahrSalam, a 29-year-old woman, described how four Tigrayan fighters locked her older parents in a separate room and then gang-raped her over a 15-hour period.Many of the survivors suffered severe and long-term physical and psychological damage, including 10 who remained hospitalized three months after they were raped. Doctors who provided medical care to rape survivors told Amnesty International that two rape survivors had to be treated for lacerations likely caused by having the bayonets of rifles inserted into their genitals.Amnesty International has previously documented similar patterns of Tigrayan fighters raping Amhara women and girls in Nifas Mewcha, and has received credible reports of rape from other areas of the Amhara region. Such atrocities constitute war crimes and, potentially, crimes against humanity.Looting of civilian propertyIn both Kobo and the Chenna area, residents told Amnesty International that Tigrayan fighters stole possessions from their homes and shops and looted and vandalized public properties, including medical clinics and schools.The looting and damage to medical facilities made it impossible for rape survivors and other residents in need of medical care to obtain treatment locally, forcing them to wait until they could reach hospitals in Debark, Gondar and Bahir Dar weeks later. For rape survivors, this was far too late to receive crucial post-rape care, some of which needs to be administered within 72 hours.“These atrocities yet again drive home the need for swift action by the international community to investigate abuses by all sides, bring those responsible to account and ensure that survivors can realise their rights,” said Sarah Jackson.“For too long, the international community has been failing victims and survivors of crimes under international law in Ethiopia. The United Nations and African Union must deploy relevant investigation teams to the region. The international commission of human rights experts on Ethiopia, established by the UN Human Rights Council in December, must also be permitted to start its work and be granted access to the country as soon as possible.”BackgroundThe conflict in Tigray broke out in November 2020 and spread to other regions of northern Ethiopia from July 2021. Amnesty International has documented a range of violations by all parties to the conflict, including massacres, extrajudicial executions and other unlawful killings, sexual and other gender-based violence and arbitrary detentions by Ethiopian government forces and allied militias and by Eritrean forces acting alongside them.The post Ethiopia: Tigrayan forces murder, rape and pillage in attacks on civilians in Amhara towns appeared first on Amnesty International. ... read full story",No,3.

Yet it is the second largest country in Africa in terms of population, has been an independent country for centuries, and the capital, Addis Ababa, serves as the headquarters of the African Union. When I was military commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, we had a strong partnership with the African Union, focused on combating piracy off the eastern coast of the continent.
Unfortunately, the nation of 115 million is now in the grips of a vicious rebellion that resembles the fighting in the Balkans of the 1990s — racial and ethnic divisions, atrocities on both sides including ethnic cleansing and gang rapes, armies fighting over territorial control, millions of refugees.
A few years ago, when Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed won the Nobel Peace Prize for settling a long-running war with Eritrea, it looked like Ethiopia had a bright future. But over the past year, thousands have been killed in a revolt in Tigray Province and by the government's efforts to suppress it. It is not yet a full civil war, one engulfing the entire population. But the combined military forces of the rebel groups are within a few of hundred miles of Addis Ababa, and the prime minister has called on all males to prepare for combat.
What are the U.S. interests in this conflict, and what should Washington be doing about it?
First, Ethiopia matters because of its size and potential. It occupies a huge landmass — more than 1.5 times the size of Texas — in the heart of the Horn of Africa. While landlocked, it is the economic and political center of the strategically important northeast coast of Africa.

Around the same time, 660 miles southeast in the city of Assab, 12 additional persons were arrested while engaging in a prayer meeting in a home. Both groups were taken to nearby prisons.
Yesterday, April 15th, the Barnabas Fund announced that 22 of the 23 Christians arrested in Asmara were released this past Sunday. It is not yet known why one Christian man was denied his freedom.
“The two raids on prayer meetings dampened hopes that the government was easing its harsh repressive policy against Christians in the country,” stated the Barnabas Fund, acknowledging the 171 Eritrean Christians that had been released from Eritrean prisons since August. While civilians hoped that these releases signaled change in the country, the recent arrests suggest that Eritrea “remains one of the worst countries in the world for Christian persecution”.
There are an estimated 500 Christian prisoners of faith in Eritrea, a country ruled by a military dictatorship. When arrested, persecuted Christians often disappear without a trace, leaving their loved ones with no information on their whereabouts or safety. Prison conditions are some of the harshest in the world, with inmates kept in shipping containers and believers often tortured in an attempt to get them to renounce their faith. While we rejoice for the newly found freedom of those released from prison in Eritrea, it is of vital importance that we continue to pray for those who remain in captivity.

March 26, 2020 (Ezega.com) -- Amnesty International is calling on the Ethiopian authorities to disclose measures it has taken to rescue 17 Amhara students of Dembi Dolo University in Western Oromia, who were abducted by unidentified people in November 2019 and have been missing since.
The anguish of the students’ families is exacerbated by a phone and internet shutdown implemented in January across the western Oromia region further hampering their efforts to get information about their missing loved ones, Amnesty International said in a statement on Thursday.
“The sense of fear and uncertainty spreading across Ethiopia because of COVID-19 is exacerbating the anguish of these students’ families, who are desperate for information on the whereabouts of their loved ones four months after they were abducted,” said Seif Magango, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for East Africa.",Yes,,X,,,,,test

On 9 March, the Somaliland Council of Ministers, in a communiqué, called on allied troops, including those of the Somali region of Ethiopia, to withdraw from Las Anod. The following day, leaders of Ethiopia’s Somali region released a statement categorically denying the allegation and called for Somaliland authorities to refrain from statements that could “alienate the people of both regions.” Somaliland, which unilaterally declared its independence in 1991 but is not internationally recognised, claims Las Anod as its own despite opposition from the governments of Somalia, the Puntland region, and local elders who want to form an independent state within Somalia.
Failed Mediation
This accusation comes on the heels of mediation efforts by the Ethiopian government to end the conflict. Ethiopian mediators had earlier met with the representatives of Sool, Sanaaag, and Cayn as well as Somaliland authorities. Somaliland’s refusal to withdraw its troops to Oog was the sticking point in the negotiations. In response, the leaders of Ethiopia’s Somali region urged the Somaliland administration to refrain from making statements that could drive a wedge between these two fraternal societies. Somaliland had previously portrayed itself as a “buffer zone” for Ethiopia and tried to sell its activities in Las Anod as fighting Al-Shabaab terrorists. Meanwhile, the government of Ethiopia has sent troops to Somalia to participate in a counter-terrorism operation. This move by Ethiopia hasn’t been received well by Somaliland’s leaders, who view it as meddling that risks souring their political relations.
Compounding Crises
The situation in Somaliland is further compounded by a humanitarian crisis that is unfolding in Ethiopia, as thousands of people fleeing the fighting in Somaliland have taken refuge in a remote area already suffering from severe drought. The UN and Ethiopian refugee agencies estimate that 98 000 people have arrived in three districts bordering Somaliland since 6 February. Shelter, food, water, and medical aid are the pressing needs for these refugees, who are mainly women and children. The refugees from Las Anod, who have reportedly been welcome by locals, express a desire to return home and are calling for solutions to the conflict in Somaliland.",No,3.

The armed forces of Ethiopia hit the infrastructure, homes, and an ambulance taking crucial medical supplies in Amhara. Accordingly, several people died when the drone strike hit the ambulance carrying urgent medical supplies to Delanta Primary Hospital from the town of Desse.
Ethiopia faces countless internal issues. This concerns ethnicity, politics, and religion (central forces versus federalism – and independence). Therefore, after an agreement was reached between the Ethiopian government and the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (a conflict involving other ethnic groups, including the Amhara), events have now spread to the Amhara region concerning the power concentration policies of the government of Ethiopia.",Yes,,X,X,,,,train

Abiy’s initial approach of cracking down on the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), the dominant party in Ethiopian politics over the past thirty years, culminated in a brutal and protracted conflict with far-reaching consequences for the country’s political and economic infrastructure. Through the support of neighboring strongman and autocrat Eritrean president Isaias Afwerki as well as Turkey, China, and the United Arab Emirates, Abiy eventually emerged victorious, but not without significant costs. As Ethiopia continues to grapple with enduring tensions and internal conflicts, and as Abiy attempts to establish a lasting legacy as a peacemaker, the role of regional actors, including Afwerki, is emerging as a critical factor in the country’s stability.
In April 2018, when Abiy became Ethiopia’s prime minister, he faced the challenge of managing a country on the brink of a civil war. His predecessor, Hailemariam Desalegn, resigned under duress, paving the way for Abiy to make history as Ethiopia’s first Oromo prime minister. As an ethnic Oromo married to an Amhara wife, Abiy was enthusiastically received by the wider Oromo community, showing their contentment with Ethiopia’s political trajectory by showing up in large numbers on the streets. In 2019, Abiy was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in ending a twenty-year conflict with neighboring Eritrea.
However, Abiy’s ascension to power coincided with deep-seated tensions between the Ethiopian government and TPLF. When he began cracking down on Tigrayan officials holding powerful positions in Ethiopia’s government, he faced multiple assassination attempts as a result. Escalating tensions eventually led to elections in September 2020, a controversial display of TLPF autonomy from the central government in Addis Ababa. The Ethiopian government deemed the move illegal, and in November of the same year, the TPLF attacked the Northern Command of the Ethiopian military, sparking the Tigray war.
Initially, the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) overran the TPLF and ousted the rebels from the Tigrayan region capital, Mekelle. However, the TPLF, resorting to classic guerrilla tactics, engaged in a game of cat and mouse with the ENDF. The ENDF’s frustration with the recalcitrance of the Tigray people, a tight-knit, highly politically conscious society, led to the full wrath of its power being brought onto the civilians in Tigray. Cases of rape, torture and extrajudicial killings were widely documented by international human rights organizations.
In June 2021, the TPLF retook Mekelle, and in November of the same year, it declared that it would push toward Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa. During that period, the TPLF's brutal retribution for the ENDF's occupation of Mekelle extended to new areas in the Amhara and Afar regions, where it unleashed large-scale atrocities against civilians with almost equal measure. Abiy temporarily handed over his duties as Ethiopia’s prime minister to his deputy and led the army himself. With Turkish and Chinese drones and Eritrean troops on the ground, the ENDF launched a blitzkrieg against the TPLF, taking back the territories that the TPLF had occupied in the previous three months in just three days.",No,3.

The most recent case is of a five-year-old boy beaten by his mother, Patience Uwimana in a video that went viral on social media. Luckily for this case, the perpetrator was traced, police arrested her on March 15, 2020. She was later charged in court which sentenced her to prison.
But how many cases of corporal punishment go unnoticed? People think, Uwimana’s case was extreme and so she deserved the punishment. However, many adults continue to give two or three canes or a slap or shout at children. This is still not okay just like it is with Uwimana’s case. The biggest damage corporal punishment has on children is emotional and psychological. It is not about what you do, but how the child experiences it.
According to End Violence Against Children, corporal punishment is the most common form of violence against children worldwide. It includes any punishment in which physical force is used and intended to cause some degree of pain or discomfort, however light, as well as non-physical forms of punishment that are cruel and degrading.
Findings from the Uganda National Violence Against Children Survey, 2018 indicate that, over 75 percent of children say they have been beaten in class. A study by Know Violence in Childhood suggests that in 2015: of the 1.7 billion, 1.3 billion boys and girls experienced corporal punishment at home.
Adults continue to use corporal punishment and as a result, we have come to think of corporal punishment as normal. Because our parents and teachers used it, we have come to understand corporal punishment as an acceptable way to relate with children. We may even have come to think of it as necessary, because people who loved us and cared about us used it. But it shouldn’t be the case, corporal punishment hurts children just like it would hurt adults. It does not matter if there are two or three canes or a slap. The humiliation you would feel with one slap would be just as damaging as with five slaps and more.

Conflict fears rise in Ethiopia
Ethiopia’s democratic transition has been wobbling for months. But now a civil war in the northern region of Tigray threatens to derail it all together. On 4 November, the federal government launched military operations against the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), which governs the area. Air raids and clashes have been reported across the region, though details remain scant, with communication networks down. The government says TPLF forces sparked the war by attacking a federal army base, though Tigrayan officials refute the claim. Once the dominant force in Ethiopian politics, the TPLF has lost influence since Nobel Peace Prize winner Abiy Ahmed took charge in 2018. Some members have been purged from government or arrested for corruption and human rights abuses. Tensions boiled over in September, when Tigray held regional elections that Addis Ababa had earlier postponed on account of the coronavirus pandemic. On 6 November, Abiy said military operations would have limited objectives – but many fear a drawn-out conflict with dangerous ramifications for the wider Horn of Africa region.",No,3.

NAIROBI, Kenya — Two Christians in eastern Uganda were hospitalized after hardline Muslims beat them for their presentation at a religious dialogue, one of the victims said.
Musa Kirongosa, 32, and Swidiki Buyinza, 27, of an undisclosed church in Nawaikoke, Kaliro District, were the first to speak at the Christian-Muslim dialogue organized by Muslims on Nov. 13 in Bulumba town. Using both the Bible and the Quran, they argued that Muhammad was a false prophet, with Kirongosa asserting, “Truth is only found in Christ Jesus as the one and the only Savior for mankind.”
Angry Muslims in attendance grew rowdy before the two Christians had finished, forcing them to flee and go into hiding at the nearby home of a Christian, Buyinza said. Some of the Muslims rushed ahead to block the road leading out of the area, and about two hours later, at about 7 p.m. when the area was vacated and quiet, the two Christians thought it was safe to leave.
“When we left around 7:30 on our motorcycle, just a few kilometers along the Nawaikoke-Bulumba road, we were stopped by Buruhan Musobya, a well-known Muslim extremist, and six other Muslims,” Buyinza told Morning Star News. “They began shouting, ‘Allah Akbar [Allah is greater], these are the enemies of our prophet, Muhammad, as well as our religion.

“We have discovered that your mission is not to fish but to hold Christian meetings and then convert Muslims to Christianity,” one of the Muslims told the Christians on June 21, according to the relative. “We are not going to take this mission of yours lightly. This is our last warning to you.”

As history has shown, the most common causes of conflict and war are the pursuits of territories and resources. [1] Territories and resources are demarcated with physical, religious, or ethnic borders, and the higher the number of borders, the higher the number of conflicts and wars. Religious and ethnic boundaries are the most dangerous boundaries on earth since they are the most common reasons for ethnic cleansings and genocides.
The colonialist empires have been using complex ethnic and religious boundaries to weaken the colonized through ethnic or religious conflicts previously during the epoch of colonialism and now in the era of neo-colonialism. The five- thousand years old Ethiopia has been defending herself from these mischiefs of colonialists until 1991 when the children of former traitors (Bandas) took power supported by the West and the rivalry powers in the region.
Unfortunately, the children of the traitors accomplished what their traitor forefathers and their colonialist masters were unable to achieve. The traitors looked at the colonialists’ map drawn to divide and conquer Ethiopia and built blood-shedding ethnic boundaries throughout the country. Perhaps, these traitors are the only morons in the universe and history who divided the people with ethnic boundaries following the mischievous maps of their unsuccessful colonialist masters, and scarified tens of thousands of their followers to make their own country land locked.
Since these ethnic boundaries were installed between the very people that lived in harmony for thousands of years, Ethiopians have been deprived of living in peace let alone exercising their God given rights. As the well-compiled graphic documentaries show, Amaras and Guragaes were thrown into cliffs alive in Bedeno right after the cursed hands drew the lines of ethnic boundaries. [2]",No,2.

Editor's note: Sr. Naomi Nkrumah, a member of the Institute of the Sisters of St. Louis from Ghana, has been keeping us in touch with what has been going on in Ethiopia and Eritrea since the early days of the conflict in the Tigray region. See one of her early columns here.
Roasa Ammuel is a 28-year-old Ethiopian from the Tigray region. She is married with two children, a boy of 8 and another 1-year-old boy. She and her husband lived in Shiraro, in west Tigray; they had a shop where they sold domestic articles. They were not rich but were able to take care of themselves and their family. Her husband was ex-military, so when the civil war between Tigray and the federal government started in November 2020, he joined the Tigray People's Liberation Front to fight. Roasa Ammuel and her two children were left on their own to take care of the shop and themselves. Their troubles began when the Eritrean military came to the region to fight against the Tigray defense force in support of Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. Roasa Ammuel said that the Eritrean military who came to their village met only women and children, and raped, beat or killed most of the women. Roasa Ammuel was one of them who suffered terrible abuse.
It took Roasa a long time to open up to the sisters because of how the people around her were treating her. Now her desire is to see her son, to recover after the war, and to reunite with her husband and the family. Tweet this
When the military men came to her house, they asked where her husband was; unfortunately for her, her 1-year-old boy told them that his father was a soldier who would fight and beat them. This revelation from the small boy made them angry, and three of the soldiers raped Roasa repeatedly and tortured her so that she could not bear children again. In her agony, she asked them why they were raping and then killing the women. The soldiers told her that they wanted to eliminate them to the third generation, and did not want them to bear children again. The soldiers stayed in the village for 10 days and continued to rape the women — even as they bled from their internal injuries — in front of their children. The Eritrean soldiers committed terrible atrocities. They brought a nursing mother to the village with her baby boy, and in sight of all the women the baby was put in a bag and stomped to death. The other boys in the village were beaten repeatedly. The military men left the village after 10 days. Many of the women were not able to walk again, but some of the ones who could tried to run away from Shiraro to get medical care. Some who decided to stay in the village died. Roasa Ammuel was one of the women who ran away from the village, in spite of how difficult it was for her to walk.

The Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), which has recaptured most of its home region in the past three weeks after an abrupt reversal in an eight-month war, has vowed to retake western Tigray, an expanse of fertile territory controlled by Amhara forces who seized it during the conflict.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed abruptly pulled central government troops out of most of Tigray last month, citing a unilateral ceasefire that the TPLF mocked as “a joke” designed to justify his forces’ retreat. Wednesday’s statement marked a shift in rhetoric, as Abiy said the ceasefire had failed to deliver.
A spokesman for the Amhara regional government also said the authorities there were rallying their own forces for a counter-attack against Tigrayan forces.
“The regional government has now transitioned from defensive to offensive,” Amhara spokesperson Gizachew Muluneh was quoted as saying by the region’s state-run Amhara Media Corporation. “Amhara militia and special forces have been systematically trying to defend but now our patience has run out and as of today we have opened an offensive attack.”",No,2.

“A Coptic Church was attacked on Sunday morning. Four people were hit by bullets and a priest was assaulted. Mosques were bombed. Two hospitals were raided, reportedly by the members of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF),” Radio Dabanga reported.
The RSF is the junta faction controlled by Mohamed Hamdan “Hemedti” Dagalo, a brutal militia that grew from the infamous Janjaweed gangs that formed in the 1980s under dictator Omar al-Bashir.
Many of the early Janjaweed fighters were merchants and camel traders banding together to protect their property. The name means “devils on horseback,” referring to their origins as irregular cavalry. Dagalo himself was a school dropout who made his living as a camel trader in Darfur before turning to militia warfare after his family trade caravan was attacked and massacred by bandits.
Bashir had the idea to organize the disparate Janjaweed groups and bring them together as a deputized force that could be deployed against his enemies. In 2013, he tapped Dagalo to head the renamed Rapid Support Forces, and their status was codified in the Sudanese constitution the following year.",Yes,,,X,,,,dev

The world’s youngest nation has already spent the better part of its existence simmering amidst a chaotic civil war. In fact, the surging violence and fuelling dissent was one of the cornerstones that aided its foundation in the first place. However, the world has changed and so has the objective of the revolt. What hasn’t changed is the butting fabric of the country that has never allowed instability to subside. And while the fighting today seems reminiscent of the blazing catastrophe that razed the region a few years ago, the complexity has jumped up a notch or two. A solution, thus, would need to resolve the festering divide instead of just patching the problem. Sounds simple, yet, the resolution should route a creative and lasting impact if the country intends to subdue the conflict before it gains momentum.
The history of the nascent country, primarily the events leading up to its independence, puts an array of aspects into perspective. Sudan existed as a single country up until a decade ago. Years and years, decades even, of repressive rule emboldened the autonomous factions within Sudan, specifically the southern states. The decades-long span of civil war between the warring states of Sudan was one of the most debilitating eras witnessed by the African continent after the period of colonization. And while the objective was to fight off the oppressive ruling class to achieve an equitable distribution of power, the struggle didn’t bore its fruit until 2005 when the Sudanese regime reluctantly allowed autonomy to the southern part of Sudan – comprising ten diverse states. The civil war culminated with an agreement that elevated Salva Kiir Mayardit – Leader of the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM) – as the President of this autonomous region.
Mr. Kiir went on to win another election in 2010 despite an ideological conflict within the ranks of the independence movement. However, the power consolidation was hardly threatened as it glimmered as a hope for the aspirations of a separate state. Infighting would have endangered the common objective. However, the struggle renditioned its cause just six years after the accord as South Sudan seceded from Sudan as an independent state in 2011.
Now as the nation sobered up from the jubilation of independence, it was particularly awakening to realize a stark reality. There was no common objective for the conflicting groups to tolerate each other. Thus, the road ahead proved to be a bumpy ride and not exactly a smooth sail as once envisioned. In reality, the very diversity of South Sudan that once weighted the cause of a liberal state, now made it vulnerable to a difference of opinion and, by extension, more prone to conflicts. The gradual build-up of frustration and irateness reached its apex just two years after independence. A dissent between two of the majority ethnic groups of South Sudan sowed the premise of another civil war – this time between the ranks of South Sudan itself.
President Kiir, stemming from the Dinka ethnic group, accused Vice President Riek Machar, belonging to the rivaling Nuer ethnic group, of plotting a failed coup against his government. Mr. Kiir sacked his entire cabinet along with Mr. Machar, leading to the eruption of violence between the two groups that once jointly campaigned for independence just a few years in retrospect.",No,2.

The two had been leading Sudan's Transitional Council, which was formed in 2019 with the intention of eventually turning power over to Sudanese civilians after a decades-long dictatorship led by Omar al-Bashir. Al-Bashir, who'd ruled Sudan since overthrowing a democratically elected government in 1989, had a brutal reign that included genocide in the western region of Darfur; human rights violations including mass killing, forcible transfer, and mass rape; and the Sudanese Civil War, which led to a partition between Sudan and South Sudan in 2011.
Now, history is repeating itself. The Sudanese Armed Forces, led by Burhan, and the Rapid Support Forces, led by Dagalo, have been engaging in all-out warfare across the country. Burhan-ordered air strikes have devastated cities and villages, while RSF forces have burnt down entire villages, robbed Sudanese people attempting to leave, raped women en masse, killed tribal leaders, and kidnapped civilians, in addition to war crimes including torture and denying people access to food, water, and essential supplies. Those who are at the greatest risk are non-Arab, non-Muslim minorities, who have been targets of bigotry for decades, particularly as a result of British-backed colonialism and the conquer-by-dividing strategy of Omar al-Bashir.
Since April, over 5,000 people have been killed in Sudan and over 12,000 have been injured, while 2.32 million have fled to neighboring countries and 2.2 million have been internally displaced. Those who have fled to neighboring Chad, South Sudan, Eritrea, and Egypt are often met with a lack of shelter, devastating poverty, and, in many cases, further violence.

The fighting poses a significant challenge to efforts by Sudan’s transitional government to end decades-long rebellions in some areas of the country, including Darfur. Rebel groups from Darfur and other areas have for months engaged in talks with the transitional authorities to establish peace in Darfur and elsewhere in Sudan.
Adam Regal, a spokesman for a local organization that helps run refugee camps in Darfur, said the violence erupted when a group from the Falata tribe robbed sheepherders from the Arab Rizeigat tribe in the town of Rumali, leading to fierce clashes between the two tribes.
Regal shared graphic footage for dead bodies and wounded with blood-stained clothes.

Many people were arrested without charge, as usual, and pushed to unknown prisons. Of course, the victims were Muslims whose ready-made accusation is extremism. However, an extremist regime is not qualified to pass judgement on violations it has perfected.
Eritreans Muslims, mostly of the Sufi persuasion, continued to celebrate their holy days, despite a fringe that objects to anything that was not practiced a millennia ago. But the regime uses, such differences as a reason to arrest people and it did arrest many. This time, it prepared the ground by issuing a statement on November 28, accusing Qatar of planning to destabilize the Eritrean regime rulers.

Since the start of the year, vandals have broken into at least seven churches in Uganda and ransacked them. Several churches in the neighboring Kenya have also been robbed in recent months.
In the latest incident, which took place during the early hours of Oct. 8, unknown vandals broke into the Catholic Sub-Parish Church in Kyotera District, Central Uganda, and made off with an unspecified amount of money and musical instruments. Religion Unplugged has learned that the thugs broke the padlock and bolts on the church’s door before accessing the building.

Paul Ssempa, the parish youth leader, said that after breaking into the church, the vandals stole the church’s piano, amplifiers and unspecified amount of money that had been kept in the Mother Mary donation box.

Versione originale in Italiano
Killed only because they were Christians. This is the terrible fate of two young sisters in Pakistan who refused to convert to Islam after the constant sexual harassment of some work colleagues. They were kidnapped, handcuffed and strangled in cold blood. A former Muslim imam from Uganda who recently converted to Christianity also suffered the same fate: assassinated only for choosing a religion that the local Muslims do not like.
These murders are particularly disturbing because they were carried out with scientific premeditation and not with instinctual brutality. Their deaths occurred in recent weeks but the cases have emerged only today also due to the embarrassment of the local authorities who do not always actively collaborate in the investigation of the crimes both in Pakistan, where the scourge of Christian girls kidnapped, raped and forced converting to marry Muslims is rampant, but also in Africa where law enforcement officers often do not want to meddle in local rivalries that go beyond religious aspects such as in Nigeria, where the clash between Muslim Fulani shepherds and Christian farmers is taking place.

Jesuit Fr. Augustine Ekeno, who serves at St. Teresa Parish in the Rumbek Diocese, told NCR that the visit, in the works since 2017, would ""bring some hope to the people in this country who have suffered for many years and who feel abandoned."" South Sudan, located just west of Ethiopia, is the world's newest state. It gained independence from Sudan in July 2011 but has rarely known peace since then, with armed conflicts breaking out among its about 64 ethnic groups and between its government and various opposition groups.

In April 2019, Francis hosted a retreat at the Vatican for South Sudanese President Salva Kiir and several of the opposition leaders, during which the pontiff literally knelt at their feet, begging for them to maintain peace. Although a later January 2020 peace deal seemed to pave the way for the papal visit — potentially to be organized alongside a visit by Archbishop Justin Welby, the leader of the Anglican Communion — the violence has increased over the past year. This month, attackers stormed the northern village of Dungob Alei, killing 13 people and injuring nearly 10 others. In April, the Catholic bishop-designate of the Rumbek Diocese, Fr. Christian Carlassare, was attacked by assailants who shot him in both legs for no apparent reason. Carlassare, an Italian-born Comboni Missionary, is now recovering at a Kenyan Hospital. In an interview with Italian Catholic channel TV2000, the priest addressed his diocese and called for people there to work on efforts at reconciliation and peace. The diverse ethnic make-up of South Sudan and the varied religious affiliations — although the country of about 11 million is some 60% Christian, many people follow a diverse set of traditional African religions — have also been a major issue to the conflict, especially considering the unexplained attacks on church leaders.

In September, the U.N. Mission in South Sudan said the COVID-19 pandemic had slowed efforts to implement an earlier 2018 peace agreement. But the head of the mission, David Shearer, also said the pandemic ""is not entirely to blame."" Parties to the conflict were frequently reverting to their ""business as usual"" approach under which ""progress on the peace agreement itself limps along,"" said Shearer. But there have been some bright spots, especially on May 9, when President Kiir finally dissolved parliament in order to allow for the appointment of members of opposition parties, as outlined in the 2018 deal. Nearly four million people in South Sudan are internally displaced or seeking refuge outside the country, according to the Irish Catholic overseas development group Trocaire. In a statement to NCR, the organization said more than eight million people in South Sudan were now expected to be in need of assistance in 2021. To add to this insecurity is a culture of fear that is gripping the country as attacks continue. ""Fear is a part of life,"" Fr. James Oyet Latansio, a Catholic Priest and General Secretary of the South Sudan Council of Churches, told NCR. ""Priests need to be in communities, where the faithful are, to serve the people, but when there is conflict, this poses a challenge."" Fr.

violence civil society bishops Tuesday, 21 June 2022
Kinshasa (Agenzia Fides) - A regional peacekeeping force to stabilize eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. This was agreed in Nairobi during the June 20 meeting between East African leaders on security in this region of the DRC, also taking into account the recent tensions between Kinshasa and Rwanda, which accuse each other of supporting anti-government guerrilla movements. ""The Heads of State indicated that the regional force should, in collaboration with the army and the administrative forces of the DRC, seek to stabilize and guarantee peace in the DRC. The Heads of State called for an immediate ceasefire and an immediate cessation of hostilities"", said a statement issued by the Kenyan presidency, which chaired the meeting. The announcement of the dispatch of the regional force to the eastern regions of the DRC provoked strong reactions in Congo. Citizens' movement Lucha said that in fact soldiers from neighboring countries are already present in the DRC ""in one form or another"". In an open letter to Congolese President Felix Tshiseked, Lucha stresses that ""the Rwandan army is associated with M23 in North Kivu and supports Red Tabara in South Kivu. The Ugandan army has been operating with its authorization in North Kivu and Ituri since November 2021. The Burundian army operates regularly in South Kivu and the South Sudanese army in the province of Haut-Hulé"". "" As for the armies from Kenya and Tanzania - continues the document sent to Fides - they are already present in North Kivu and Ituri as part of the United Nations Rapid Intervention Force"". Lucha recalls that in eastern DRC, various local and foreign forces have been vying for control of territory and local resources for more than 30 years, and that Congolese territory is used by certain foreign armed movements to launch attacks against their governments. The presence of UN blue helmets for decades has not made it possible to secure the area. Instead of the regional force, Lucha calls for a reinforcement of the UN forces, the withdrawal of the Ugandan military, the launch of a process of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of the militias and the creation of an international tribunal for the east of the DRC. Faced with the escalation of violence committed by the M23, the Bishop of Goma, His Excellency Mgr. Willy Ngumbi Ngengele had recently urged ""not to fall into the trap of the enemies of peace"". ""In the situation of recurrent insecurity in the east of the DRC, it is important to ask for peace, a precious treasure that has been denied to us for more than three decades"". (L.M.)

When Sudan’s long-standing president Omar al-Bashir was ousted on April 11, 2019, protesters who had placed their lives on the line hoped this would mark the beginning of a freer and more just Sudan. Two years on, amidst slow progress and complex challenges, protesters, lawyers, and families of victims are understandably concerned over whether justice will ever come for abuses against those protestors.
The former regime responded ruthlessly to protests that began in December 2018 against al-Bashir’s regime, and security forces, notably Sudan’s National Security and Intelligence Service (NISS), used lethal force, including live ammunition, to break up the protests, killing dozens of unarmed protesters.",No,3.

Ignored by western governments and largely overlooked by media a genocide is taking place in Ethiopia. The Amhara people, a large ethnic group, are being ethnically cleansed from the region of Oromia, the largest region on the country.
Tens of thousands of Amhara have been killed by Oromo fanatics, over three million have been displaced, homes, land and livestock stolen.
The Oromo Liberation Front (OLF or Shene) are responsible for the violence, with the support of the local authority (the Oromo Regional Authority), the regional militia, and the consent of the federal government.
In addition to mass murder and wholesale displacement, estimates claim that more than 30,000 Amhara have been arrested this year alone.

This concerning development has reached the major cities of Gonaives and Cap-Hatien, leading to a significant surge in killings, kidnappings, and sexual assaults over the past few months. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres detailed these troubling findings in a report circulated on Wednesday.
According to the report, there were a staggering 2,728 intentional killings recorded between October 2022 and June 2023, including 247 women, 58 boys, and 20 girls. This surge in homicides is attributed to the emergence of a vigilante movement known as “Bwa Kale” in the capital city in April. This group has been actively targeting the gangs, contributing to the violent upswing.
Kidnappings for ransom have also increased during this period, with 1,472 cases reported. However, Guterres noted that the actual number is likely higher because families often do not report missing loved ones to authorities out of fear for their safety. Furthermore, gang members have continued to employ sexual violence, including collective rape, as a means of terrorizing populations under the control of rival gangs. The report cited 452 reported rape cases between October and June.
This report from the Secretary-General arrives as the UN Security Council is in negotiations over a new resolution. This resolution would authorize a non-UN multinational force led by Kenya to combat the gangs. Diplomats anticipate a vote on this resolution later in the week or the following week.
Haiti has been plagued by political instability since the still-unsolved assassination of President Jovenel Moise in 2021. Gangs have grown in power since his assassination, with Guterres noting that they now control or wield influence over 80% of the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area. Their violent activities have also expanded into the central Artibonite Valley, as well as major cities like Gonaives in the northwest and Cap-Hatien in the north.

This week alone, some ten people have been killed in inter-clan clashes in Mandera County along the Kenya-Ethiopia border. Scores have been injured in retaliatory attacks even as tension remains high in the region. Communities from both sides have vowed revenge attacks, prompting authorities to hold reconciliation meetings.
This is unfortunate because it is not the first time such clashes have occurred. In the process, innocent children, women and unarmed people lose their lives in the most heartless ways. The raiders attack villages and kill anyone on sight, believing that they are avenging their loss. Livestock and livelihoods are destroyed and poverty becomes a cycle for residents from both countries.

They should also seek long-term solutions to these perennial clashes. What is it that makes the border communities always fight? Cattle rustling and fights over pasture should be history now.
And because the region is arid and semi-arid lands, the two governments must address the perennial drought through various methods.

Throughout the world the ideology of division and intolerance has permeated mainstream politics and poisoned societies; tribal nationalism, hate and prejudice are widespread, animosity and suspicion toward ‘the other’ commonplace. In Ethiopia this vile, fear based trinity appears to have become government policy.
The focus of the regime’s enmity is the Amhara people, a large ethnic group making up around 30% of the population. In the last four years Amhara communities living in the Oromo region have been subjected to sustained violence by Oromo nationalists; the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF)/Oromo Liberation Army (OLA), together with Oromo Special Forces ((OSF) and the Queero (Oromo youth group) are behind the violence, with it seems, the approval, perhaps active participation, of the government.
Ethnic cleansing of Oromia is part of an OLF plan to create an independent Oromo nation (Oromia for the Oromo people), and reduce the overall number of Amhara in the country. Tens of thousands of Amhara civilians have been killed, thousands of homes destroyed on the outskirts of the capital Addis Ababa (which sits within Oromia), hundreds of thousands displaced (Ethiopia has around 5.6 million internally displaced people according to the UN). Anyone talking about the violence, journalists, human rights workers, lawyers or students, run the risk of arrest.

(Nairobi) – The Eritrean government has in recent months punished relatives of thousands of alleged draft evaders as part of an intensive forced conscription campaign, Human Rights Watch said today.
Eritrean security forces have been heavily involved in operations in support of the Ethiopian government since the outbreak of conflict in Ethiopia’s Tigray region in November 2020, and have carried out some of the conflict’s worst abuses. Eritrean authorities have conducted waves of roundups in Eritrea to identify people it considers draft evaders or deserters. Since September 2022, when Ethiopian and Eritrean forces carried out joint offensives in the Tigray region, the Eritrean government has inflicted further repression, punishing family members of those seeking to avoid conscription or recall, to enforce widespread forced mobilization, including of older men. Such punishment has included arbitrary detentions and home expulsions.
“Struggling to fill its dwindling fighting ranks, Eritrea’s government has detained and expelled older people and women with young children from their homes in order to find people it considers draft evaders or deserters,” said Laetitia Bader, deputy Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “Eritrea should immediately end its collective punishment of relatives of those who refuse to comply and instead focus on reforming its ruthless indefinite military service system.”
Eritrea has a policy of indefinite national service, including compulsory military conscription, which has been central to the government’s broader repression of its population since the 1998-2001 border war with Ethiopia, and its aftermath.",No,3. A summary of different situations,,,,,,test

One of the Kenyans featured is historian and digital heritage scholar Chao Tayiana, the founder of the African Digital Heritage Project (ADHP), an organization focusing on the use of technology in preserving and sharing African heritage.
“It really flipped the script as to who is uncivilized,” Tayiana says in the film, which reveals details from a secret archive known as the “Hanslope Disclosure” that remained hidden from public view for over 50 years. The archive contained damning evidence on Britain’s use of torture including murder, rape, and forced castrations against Mau Mau prisoners. Surviving veterans of this period are also featured in the film, and describe the appalling conditions they endured in detention.

“Oral history is treated as second rate compared to written knowledge, and so it hasn’t mattered in many years that veterans and people who lived through this period have been saying that this happened,” Tayiana tells Quartz. “It was only until the disclosure of the archives proving that there was torture that people really started listening.”
